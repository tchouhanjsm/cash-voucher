# Cash Voucher — Execution Plan

**Date:** 21 October 2026  
**Integration branch:** client-main  
**Reviewed baseline:** d5ed3e77387d0f1896c97dbaac793ed23b17eb32, post-PR #197  
**Release state:** live staging and first-customer acceptance remain unverified.

## Executive decision

Do not start a broad feature sprint. Run a coherent release-readiness batch that aligns branch policy, manual staging controls, source baseline and release evidence. Pass live staging and recovery gates before starting the pilot. This plan does not authorize production changes.

## Immediate pipeline — preserve this order

PRs #197 and #198 are merged. Next is staging release, not another feature sprint.

### 1. Complete the source release

- PRs #197 and #198 are merged to `client-main`.
- PR #198 head `acc93eb68cec21b1c0510c31fc5f4c82c5481e1d` passed CI/Quality, Browser E2E and Full Flight Test.
- Green source checks do not prove live deployment or recovery.

### 2. Prepare and identify staging

- Verify the staging Script, Sheet, receipt/backup folders, existing Web App deployment and `/exec` URL.
- Confirm private-host access and a staging ZIP with the verified API URL and `CV_ENVIRONMENT=staging`.
- Record staging IDs privately; prove none overlap production. Verify the protected `staging` Environment and `client-main` restriction.

### 3. Back up, then migrate staging

- Back up the confirmed staging Sheet and receipts; inspect the snapshot and manifest.
- Inspect Vouchers/Vendors headers and row counts. With owner approval, run only required `migrateVoucherPaymentMethodField()` and `migrateVendorDefaultsSchema()`.
- Preserve historical `PaymentMethod` blanks. Stop on unexpected headers or occupied columns. Never infer old methods, overwrite unknown data or migrate production.
- Verify Vouchers W, Vendors H:I, row counts and historic values.

### 4. Deploy backend first and run staging UAT

- Upload reviewed backend source to the verified staging Script and update its existing deployment; verify ID and URL.
- Then publish the static frontend with the verified API URL and `CV_ENVIRONMENT=staging`.
- Dispatch the manual [Staging UAT workflow](https://github.com/tchouhanjsm/cash-voucher/blob/client-main/.github/workflows/staging-uat.yml) from `client-main`. Run `validate-only` first. Writes require exact `STAGING-ONLY` and explicit staging-write consent.
- Preserve sanitized logs and exact-run evidence. Mock E2E is not live UAT.

### 5. Prove operational readiness

On the deployed staging instance and intended devices, verify:

- Owner/Manager/Staff authorization and denied API actions.
- Payments, receipts, Cash vs UPI/Bank, payee defaults and duplicate warnings.
- Independent approval, cash close, offline queue/reconnect/recovery.
- Print/PDF/A5, responsive layout, keyboard, zoom/reflow and assistive technology.
- Back up the migrated staging instance and restore to a **separate recovery Sheet/folder**. Reconcile headers, counts, voucher numbering, users/settings and receipts.

### 6. Controlled 14-day hotel pilot

Only after steps 2–5 pass, document acceptance, fallback and support boundaries. Track daily reconciliation, cash variance, Cash vs UPI/Bank, each-device offline queues, backup freshness, incidents/recovery and owner/manager sign-off. Pause for missing/duplicate vouchers, unexplained variance, missing receipts, failed backup, unauthorized access, target mismatch or unrecoverable offline entries. Production stays separately gated.

**Exit rule:** source checks do not complete operational gates. Do not start the next feature batch until pilot evidence identifies a bottleneck.

## Branch and source controls

- All product PRs target client-main from short-lived client/* branches.
- Require CI, Browser E2E and Full Flight Test on the exact final PR head; fix failures instead of bypassing checks.
- Keep main legacy/read-only. The 21 October comparison showed client-main 13 commits ahead and 2 behind main, with merge base acebc6b63010a92e136200321fc77c03dac9a3be. Do not merge, rebase or force-push long-lived branches as part of this work.
- Owner/admin must verify active GitHub rulesets, required checks, default branch and the restrictions on main. Available repository metadata did not prove ruleset enforcement.
- Keep repository branch policy separate from staging/production deployment authorization.
- Never dispatch deploy/UAT from `main`; dispatch it only from `client-main`.

**Exit:** branch and exact-head check behavior is verified; any remaining owner-side settings tasks are recorded.

## Source release status

PR #198 is merged. Its merged head passed CI/Quality, Browser E2E and Full Flight Test. The release-governance batch is complete; live staging and customer acceptance remain unverified.

## Phase D — device and usability gate

Test real customer devices for installation/update, narrow and desktop layout, save confirmation, receipt capture, offline state, reconnection, idempotent sync, queue export/recovery, print/PDF/A5, keyboard focus, zoom/reflow and assistive technology. Check every operating device; one browser cannot prove all offline queues are synchronized. Involve an owner/manager, not engineers only.

**Exit:** device/browser matrix, repeatable evidence, critical defects resolved and recovery demonstrated.

## Phase E — design-partner pilot

Start only after prior gates pass and the customer instance is accepted. Document scope, fees, support hours, data ownership, export/exit, known limitations, fallback, escalation and acceptance. Do not share broad Google/hosting credentials.

Run a 14-day controlled pilot with named owner and manager. Record daily movement reconciliation; physical drawer count and variance; Cash vs UPI/Bank; approvals/close status; offline queues across all devices; backup state; incidents/missing receipts; recovery time; and owner/manager sign-off.

Stop on missing/duplicate vouchers, unexplained variance, missing receipts, unauthorized access, failed backup, target mismatch or unrecoverable offline entries.

## Phase F — next product batch after evidence

Consider one integrated **Today → Close → Owner card** workflow: Today prioritizes actions/exceptions; Close guides sync, pending approvals, physical drawer and classification; Owner card separates cash and non-cash movements and shows verifiable exception/sync/backup state. Define the target task, baseline and outcome metric before building. If pilot data shows another bottleneck, work on that instead.

## Priority queue

- **P0 — Release-readiness PR.** Owner: engineering/reviewer. Acceptance: exact-head CI, Browser E2E and Flight Test.
- **P0 — Branch rulesets/default branch.** Owner: repository owner/admin. Acceptance: actual GitHub Settings state recorded.
- **P0 — Staging identity and UAT.** Owner: operator + owner. Acceptance: isolated resource register and exact workflow run.
- **P0 — Backup and restore.** Owner: owner/operator. Acceptance: restore into a separate target with reconciliation.
- **P0 — Device/offline/print/accessibility.** Owner: QA + customer operator. Acceptance: device matrix and critical issues closed.
- **P1 — Controlled pilot.** Owner: product owner + customer. Acceptance: written acceptance and 14-day evidence.
- **P1 — Next product batch.** Owner: product/engineering. Acceptance: observed problem, baseline and success metric.
- **P2 — Durable audit-failure fallback.** Owner: security/backend. Acceptance: failure/retention/access decision.
- **P2 — Accountant mapping.** Owner: customer/accountant. Acceptance: chosen software/version and anonymized fixture.
- **P2 — Database/multi-tenant architecture.** Owner: founder/architecture. Acceptance: measured scaling trigger and migration business case.

## Non-goals and stop conditions

No production migration/deployment, blind branch synchronization, multi-tenant rewrite, AI dependency, autonomous posting, outbound WhatsApp campaign, unvalidated tax/ledger claim or mandatory denomination schema change. Staging is unverified until live UAT, backup and isolated restore are evidenced. Customer handover is blocked until access, device, data ownership and acceptance gates pass.
