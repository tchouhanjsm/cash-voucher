**Verified main SHA:** `c9ccc829076b9d461372cd6a2959342286cc04a4`  
**Source of truth:** live GitHub refs and exact-head workflow runs. PR descriptions hold the authoritative current CI/E2E links.

## Product and architecture

Cash Voucher is a single-property cash-voucher PWA backed by Google Apps Script, Google Sheets and Drive. `index.html` loads `frontend/main.js`; `frontend/core/` owns shared infrastructure; `frontend/features/` owns feature behavior; `backend/Code.gs` is the API source. Root `app.js` is legacy and is not loaded by `index.html`.

Server-side authorization is authoritative. Browser-local offline entries are not centrally backed up until synchronized. Recorded backup status does not prove snapshot completeness or restoreability. Daily cash close remains design-only until the owner approves the decisions in `docs/DAILY-CASH-CLOSE-DESIGN.md`.

## Current PR state

- PR #46 is merged to `main`; backup failure cleanup, lock safety, and removal of the arbitrary commit-count ceiling are in the integration history. Its mock tests do not prove live Drive/restore behavior.
- PR #47 is closed without merge to avoid stacking; its formatting correction was included in #46.
- PR #48 is merged into `main` (merge commit `49142bd92eb3ef45a0dee70610d874612c40523a`); its contrast/financial readability foundation passed CI and 75 Browser E2E checks.
- PR #49 merged on 9 October 2026 (merge commit `dd70819f02c564ad4df433e27342d7a53dd004b6`). Its Browser E2E passed 93 checks; use the live PR description for exact CI evidence.
- PR #50 merged on 9 October 2026 (merge commit `c9ccc829076b9d461372cd6a2959342286cc04a4`); it adds a 19-pair contrast check and dialog Escape/focus-return handling. The live PR records the exact-head CI/E2E evidence.
- No Apps Script production deployment, live backup/restore, or production-data operation has been performed.

## Process decisions

- No hard commit-count ceiling; judge coherence, reviewability, final diff and evidence.
- No history rewrite or force-push. Avoid stacked PRs; fold safe corrections into the active PR.
- Every PR requires `docs/pr-handoffs/PR-<number>.md` and an updated `docs/HANDOFF.md`.
- The owner reviews and merges. Do not merge, deploy Apps Script, or mutate production data on the owner's behalf.
- Local repository synchronization is the owner's post-approval step; do not ask for a local sync while the PR is under review.

## Current batch: PR #52

Scope: isolate the background app from keyboard/screen-reader interaction while a modal is open, and extend browser regression coverage for focus cycling and Escape behavior. No backend/API, permission, voucher schema, or accounting semantics change.

**Active PR head:** `e5498ebffa67e60d254421e00153401a65a3638f` (fresh CI and Browser E2E results are linked from PR #52).

Next steps:

1. Verify CI and Browser E2E on the exact live PR #52 head.
2. If either fails, diagnose and fix on the same branch; do not create a stacked PR.
3. Leave PR #52 for owner review/merge; owner controls merge and deployment.
4. After merge, continue with zoom/reflow and reduced-motion review, then prioritize one-thumb mobile task flows. Real screen-reader review still requires manual assistive-technology testing.

## Operational gates still open

- Live Drive permissions, scheduled trigger behavior, backup completeness and restore into a separate Sheet/folder are unverified.
- Real Apps Script lock contention and Google service quotas/timeouts are not proven by mocks.
- Daily cash close semantics/schema remain unapproved.
- Real-device PWA install/update, formal accessibility evaluation and hotel pilot remain outstanding.
